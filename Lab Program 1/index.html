			In <b>2019</b >, the department of Information Science & Engineering (ISE) collaborated with ICT Academy to offer industry-based courses like Google (for Cloud and Android courses), and UiPath (for Robotic Process Automation course). Since 2020, ISE is part of Googleâ€™s Career Readiness Program. Department has a high placement rate with<i> attractive packages and has a high-end NVIDIA server</i> to explore more into data analytics and also has qualified and supportive faculty to cater to the needs of the aspiring students and upgrade their skills.

			<h2>Web</h2>
			<p>The "Web" is often used as a synonym for the internet as a whole, but technically it means WorldWideWeb services over the internet. These services are a specialized routine (HTTP, HyperText Transfer Protocol) for encoding and routing both requests for information and delivery of information that may be in the form of both text and graphic images, integrated into files that appear on the computer screen as something like a full-color magazine page layout. Extensions of the original system now allow audio and video to be transmitted as well as computer files of all types.</p>
		<p>One computer communicates with another via the internet using the HTTP procedures. The Server computer holds files that someone has put there. Another computer, called the Client computer, users a program called a Browser (e.g. Netscape Navigator, Internet Explorer, Mosaic, Lynx) to send a request for a particular file to the Server computer. The Server sends back the file, and the Browser displays it on the screen.
</p><p>
Every website file has an address, or URL (Universal Resource Locator). It consists of the address of its Server computer, followed by its local address (or an alias) in the memory of that computer. http://academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu/education/index.htm
Protocol -- Host Server computer address -- Website Directory -- Filename
</p><p>
Most website files are HTML files and end in the extension ".html" (on UNIX operating system computers) or ".htm" (on Windows PC computers). Web servers can also deliver other kinds of files as accessories to the main HTML files, including graphic images (*.jpeg or *.jpg, *.gif, etc.) and audio (*.au, *.ra, *.wav, etc.) or video or other kinds of files. These other files are integrated into the webpage display by the Browser. Normally one webpage consists of one HTML file plus its auxiliary files.
</p><p>
Many websites also have a default HTML file, one that is displayed if no specific file is requested. This is often called the Homepage file and is usually the starting point for finding information on a website. The URL then consists of just the host Server computer address plus the directory address of the whole website:
http://academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu/education/
Protocol -- Host Server computer address -- Website main directory</p>

			<h2>Lan</h2>
			<p>A local area network (LAN) is a collection of devices connected together in one physical location, such as a building, office, or home. A LAN can be small or large, ranging from a home network with one user to an enterprise network with thousands of users and devices in an office or school.</p>
			<p>
A LAN comprises cables, access points, switches, routers, and other components that enable devices to connect to internal servers, web servers, and other LANs via wide area networks.</p>
			
			<p>The rise of virtualization has also fueled the development of virtual LANs, which enable network administrators to logically group network nodes and partition their networks without a need for major infrastructure changes.</p>
			<p>For example, in an office with multiple departments, such as accounting, IT support, and administration, each department's computers could be logically connected to the same switch but segmented to behave as if they are separate.</p>
